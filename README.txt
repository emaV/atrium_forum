atrium_forum
============

Open Atrium Forum feature.

Installation instructions: place the contents of this directory in an
atrium_forum subdirectory under sites/all/modules/features in your
Open Atrium installation, then enable the feature from the Features
administration panel and activate it on a per-group basis.

If the site is not empty (i.e. you have already groups) hook_install will
run a NAT Sync operation: this will create NAT associations (and terms)
for group nodes not present in the NAT table.
